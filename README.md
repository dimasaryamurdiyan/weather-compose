## Android App Architecture - Guideline to App Architecture

**Top tip**: A module graph (shown above) can be useful during modularization planning for
visualizing dependencies between modules.

The Weather app contains the following types of modules:

* The `presentation` module - contains presentation layer that contains ViewModel, Navigation Graph and Composable Function.
* `data` module - contains operation about accessing or manipulating data both network nor local.
  This module depend on `domain` module, but it shouldnâ€™t depend on `presentation` module.
* `domain` module - most deep layer that contains all business logic for each specific usecase, such as `GetForecastUseCase`, `AddCityUseCase`, etc. This module not depend to any module, because this is the deepest layer based on Clean Architecture guidelines.
* `di` module - contains scaffolding classes that bind the rest of codebases.
* `utils` module - basically common module that contains extension function, helper, or constant data.
